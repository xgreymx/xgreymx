Dear Victorique,

I really appreciate your kind gesture in helping me build a beautiful profile like yours. I'm not someone who makes friends easily, so you don’t know how much this means to me. If it’s not too much to ask, could I get an Eris Greyrat or Mushoku Tensei design? I’ve read all the light novels, and it’s a work that truly changed my life. If that’s not possible, don’t worry — I’ll love any design you make.

With love from Mexico,
Your friend,
Grey
